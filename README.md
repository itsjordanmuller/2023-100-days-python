## Day 1

### Projects (Day 1)

#### [1. Band Name Generator](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-001/Projects/band-name-generator.py)

### Exercises (Day 1)

#### [A. Hello World](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-001/Exercises/0-hello-world.py)

In this exercise, I learned about handling user input, string manipulation, and outputting data. I used the `input()` function to prompt for and receive the user's name. This taught me how to interact with users and capture their responses in a program.

Next, I used the `len()` function to calculate the length of the entered name, which showed me how to work with string properties and perform basic calculations. Finally, I printed both the name and its length to the console, reinforcing my understanding of how to display output in Python.

#### [B. Printing](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-001/Exercises/1-printing.py)

This exercise involved printing text to the console, a fundamental skill in many language, not just Python. I learned how to structure the `print` function and the syntax for outputting strings.

I printed multiple lines, each demonstrating a different aspect of the print function. Starting with a basic introduction line, I moved on to describe how the function is declared, and then displayed an example of the `print` function in action. This helped me understand the basics of displaying text in Python, a key component in many programming tasks.

#### [C. Debugging Practice](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-001/Exercises/2-debugging-practice.py)

In this exercise, I focused on debugging Python code, specifically addressing syntax errors in string manipulation and print statements. I encountered issues like a missing quotation mark, inconsistent use of single and double quotes, and an indentation error.

By correcting these errors, I practiced paying close attention to syntax details, the nuances between single and double quotes, and how proper indentation is crucial. This task was a practical lesson in troubleshooting and refining my understanding of Python syntax, particularly in relation to string handling and output formatting.

#### [D. Input Function](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-001/Exercises/3-input-function.py)

In this exercise, I learned to use the `input()` function to capture user input and the `len()` function to calculate the length of a string.

The program first prompts the user to enter their name, storing the response in variable `a`. Then, it calculates and prints the length of the inputted name using `len(a)`.

This demonstrated how to interact with users and process their input, as well as basic string manipulation.

#### [E. Variables](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-001/Exercises/4-variables.py)

The challenge of this exercise was to swap the values of two variables without altering the given input and output code sections.

Initially, the program collected user inputs for variables `a` and `b`. My task was to write code in the designated area to swap the values of these two variables.

To achieve this, I introduced two new variables, `export_a` and `export_b`, to temporarily hold the values of `a` and `b`. Then, I reassigned the values of a and b by swapping them using the temporary variables.

The final output then reflected the swapped values, demonstrating successful variable manipulation. Through this exercise, I learned a practical application of variables.

## Day 2

### Projects (Day 2)

#### [2. Tip Calculator](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-002/Projects/tip-calculator.py)

### Exercises (Day 2)

#### [A. Primitive Data Types](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-002/Exercises/0-primitive-data-types.py)

In this exercise, I focused on different primitive data types and their operations. I worked with strings, accessing and manipulating characters, integers and floats, performing basic arithmetic operations, and understanding the nuances of different number types.

A significant part of the exercise was learning about type conversion, such as changing integers to strings or strings to floats. I used the `type()` function for identifying data types. The exercise also covered Python's order of operations (PEMDAS), including standard division, floor division, and rounding numbers.

Finally, I practiced incrementing variables and formatting strings to include multiple variables, enhancing my understanding of Python's data handling and string formatting capabilities.

#### [B. Data Types](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-002/Exercises/1-data-types.py)

In this exercise, I worked on manipulating and calculating with string and integer data types in Python. The challenge was to take a two-digit number as a string input, extract each digit, convert them into integers, and then sum them.

After capturing the two-digit number as a string input, I extracted the first and second digits using indexing. Then, I converted these string digits into integers using the `int()` function. Finally, I added these two integer values together and printed the result.

This exercise taught me about string indexing, type conversion from strings to integers, and basic arithmetic operations in Python. It was a practical application of combining several fundamental programming concepts.

#### [C. BMI Calculator](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-002/Exercises/2-bmi-calculator.py)

In this exercise, I developed a basic BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator in Python. The program begins by asking the user to input their height in meters and weight in kilograms.

To calculate the BMI, I first converted the height and weight inputs from strings to floats using the `float()` function. Then, I applied the BMI formula, which is weight divided by height squared. Finally, I converted the resulting BMI value to an integer using the `int()` function for a cleaner output and printed the result.

This task was a practical application of input handling, type conversion, arithmetic operations, and output formatting in Python. It demonstrated how to build a simple yet functional tool using basic programming concepts.

#### [D. Life in Weeks](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-002/Exercises/3-life-in-weeks.py)

In this exercise, I created a program to calculate the time a person has left in days, weeks, and months, assuming they live up to 90 years old. The user inputs their current age, and the program computes the remaining time.

First, I converted the user's age from a string to an integer. Then, I calculated the years remaining by subtracting the user's age from 90. Using this value, I determined the months, weeks, and days left by multiplying the years remaining with the number of months, weeks, and days in a year, respectively.

The final output was formatted using a Python f-string to neatly display the calculated days, weeks, and months remaining. This exercise taught me about basic arithmetic operations, type conversion, and string formatting in Python, along with providing a practical application of these skills.

## Day 3

### Projects (Day 3)

#### [3. Treasure Island - Choose Your Adventure CLI Game](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-003/Projects/treasure-island.py)

### Exercises (Day 3)

#### [A. Control Flow](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-003/Exercises/0-control-flow.py)

In this exercise, I learned about implementing control flow in Python using conditional statements. The program simulates a rollercoaster ticketing system that determines eligibility and ticket pricing based on the user's height and age.

The program starts by welcoming the user and asking for their height in centimeters. It then initializes a variable `bill` to 0, which will later be used to calculate the total ticket cost.

The first `if` statement checks if the user is tall enough to ride the rollercoaster (height >= 120 cm). If so, it proceeds to ask for the user's age to determine the ticket price:
- If the user is under 12 years old, they are charged $5.
- If the user is between 12 and 18 years old, they are charged $7.
- If the user is between 45 and 55 years old, they ride for free.
- All other ages are considered adults and are charged $12.

Next, the program asks if the user wants a photo taken. If the answer is "Y" for yes, an additional $3 is added to the bill.

Finally, the total bill is calculated and displayed. If the user is not tall enough to ride, the program prints a message indicating they cannot ride the rollercoaster.

#### [B. Odd or Even](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-003/Exercises/1-odd-or-even.py)

In this exercise, I focused on creating a simple program in Python to determine if a number is odd or even. The program begins by prompting the user to input a number, which is then converted to an integer using the `int()` function.

The core of this program lies in the use of the modulus operator (`%`) to check if the number is odd or even. The modulus operator returns the remainder of a division operation. In this case, it checks the remainder of the number divided by 2.

The `if` statement checks if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is equal to 1 (`number % 2 == 1`):
- If true, it means the number is odd, and the program prints "This is an odd number."
- If false (i.e., the remainder is 0), it means the number is even, and the program prints "This is an even number."

This exercise was a straightforward yet effective demonstration of using the modulus operator to perform a common mathematical check in programming and covered essential concepts like input handling, type conversion, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations in Python. 

#### [C. BMI Calculator V2 Upgrade](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-003/Exercises/2-bmi-calculator-v2.py)

In this exercise, I progressed to an advanced version of the BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator (version 2), enhancing the functionality to provide more detailed feedback based on the BMI value. Compared to version 1, this version includes conditional statements to categorize the BMI result into different health categories.

Key changes and learnings in this version include:

1. **Immediate Type Conversion of Inputs**: Unlike version 1 where the height and weight inputs were initially taken as strings and then converted to floats, version 2 directly converts the user inputs to floats. This streamlines the code.

2. **Rounded BMI Calculation**: The BMI is calculated using the same formula as in version 1 (weight divided by height squared). However, in version 2, the `round()` function is used to round the BMI to the nearest whole number, providing a more user-friendly output.

3. **Conditional Statements for Health Categories**: The program uses a series of `if-elif-else` statements to categorize the BMI value:
    - A BMI less than 18.5 is categorized as underweight.
    - A BMI from 18.5 to less than 25 is considered normal weight.
    - A BMI from 25 to less than 30 is categorized as slightly overweight.
    - A BMI from 30 to less than 35 is considered obese.
    - A BMI of 35 or more is categorized as clinically obese.

    Each category triggers a specific print statement, providing the user with both their BMI value and the corresponding health category.

#### [D. Leap Year](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-003/Exercises/3-leap-year.py)

In this exercise, I developed a program in Python to determine whether a given year is a leap year. The program employs nested conditional statements to apply the rules that define a leap year.

The process begins with prompting the user to input a year, which is then converted into an integer using the `int()` function.

The rules for determining a leap year are as follows:
1. **Divisible by 4**: The year must be evenly divisible by 4.
2. **Century Years**: If the year is a century (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.

The program's logic is structured as:
- First, it checks if the year is divisible by 4. If not, it's not a leap year.
- If the year is divisible by 4, it then checks if it's a century year (divisible by 100). 
  - If it is a century year, it must also pass the check of being divisible by 400 to be considered a leap year.
  - If it's not a century year, it is a leap year.

This arrangement of `if-else` statements within each other, known as nested conditional statements, effectively applies these rules. Based on these checks, the program prints either "Leap year." or "Not leap year." accordingly.

This exercise was an excellent demonstration of how nested conditional statements can be used to solve problems that require multiple layers of decision-making. It covered concepts like input handling, arithmetic operations with the modulus operator, and complex conditional logic in Python.

#### [E. Pizza Order](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-003/Exercises/4-pizza-order.py)

In this exercise, I created a simple pizza order calculator in Python to demonstrate conditional logic and basic arithmetic operations. The program simulates a pizza ordering process, calculating the total cost based on the customer's choices.

The program begins by welcoming the user to "Python Pizza Deliveries" and prompts them to choose the size of the pizza (Small, Medium, or Large), whether they want pepperoni, and if they desire extra cheese.

The logic of the program is structured as follows:
1. **Base Price for Pizza Size**: The program first checks the size of the pizza. Depending on whether it's Small (S), Medium (M), or Large (L), a base price is set (15, 20, or 25 dollars respectively).
2. **Adding Cost for Pepperoni**: If the user opts for pepperoni, an additional cost is added. This cost varies based on the size of the pizza (2 dollars for Small, 3 dollars for Medium and Large).
3. **Extra Cheese Addition**: Independently of the size and pepperoni choice, if the user wants extra cheese, an additional 1 dollar is added to the total price.

After considering all these choices, the final bill is calculated and printed to the user.

This exercise was a practical application of using `if-elif-else` statements to handle multiple conditions and update a variable based on these conditions. It also demonstrated string comparison in conditional statements and basic arithmetic operations for calculating the total price.

#### [F. Love Calculator](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-003/Exercises/5-love-calculator.py)

In this exercise, I created a playful "Love Calculator" program in Python, which combines string manipulation, arithmetic operations, and conditional logic. The program calculates a "love score" based on the names of two individuals.

The program starts by welcoming the user to the Love Calculator and prompts them to input two names. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Combine and Lowercase Names**: The entered names are concatenated and converted to lowercase. This is to ensure that the counting of letters is not case-sensitive.

2. **Counting Specific Letters for 'TRUE' and 'LOVE'**:
   - It counts the occurrences of each letter in 'TRUE' (t, r, u, e) within the combined string.
   - Similarly, it counts the occurrences of each letter in 'LOVE' (l, o, v, e) within the combined string.
   - The counts for each set of letters are then summed to form two numbers.

3. **Calculating the Love Score**: The love score is formed by concatenating the sums of 'TRUE' and 'LOVE' counts and converting this string back to an integer.

4. **Conditional Statements for Output**:
   - If the love score is less than 10 or greater than 90, a humorous message is printed, indicating a volatile combination.
   - If the love score is between 40 and 50, it prints a message suggesting moderate compatibility.
   - For all other scores, the love score is simply printed.

This exercise was a fun and creative way to apply various Python programming concepts & excellent for understanding basic programming concepts in a light-hearted context. It involved string concatenation, the use of the `count()` method for strings, arithmetic operations, type conversions, and implementing conditional logic based on calculated values.

## Day 4

### Projects (Day 4)

#### [4. Rock Paper Scissors - CLI Game](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-004/Projects/4-rock-paper-scissors.py)

### Exercises (Day 4)

#### [A. Random Module](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-004/Exercises/0-random-module.py)

In this exercise, I explored various aspects of Python programming, including the use of the `random` module, list manipulation, and commenting out code. The program is a collection of small snippets demonstrating different concepts.

1. **Using the `random` Module**:
   - The program starts by importing the `random` module, which provides functions for generating random numbers.
   - `random.randint(1, 10)` generates a random integer between 1 and 10.
   - `random.random() * 5` generates a random floating-point number between 0 and 5.

2. **Generating a Random Love Score**:
   - The program uses `random.randint(1, 100)` to simulate a random love score between 1 and 100, showcasing a practical application of generating random numbers. This is just as scientific as the first method used (neither is scientific in any way).

3. **List Manipulation and Access**:
   - A list named `states_of_america` is created, containing names of U.S. states.
   - The program demonstrates accessing the first and last elements of the list using index `0` and `-1` respectively.
   - Although there are commented lines for modifying the list (like changing an element and extending the list), they are not executed in the current version.

4. **Nested Lists and List Concatenation**:
   - The `dirty_dozen` list is created by concatenating two lists, `fruits` and `vegetables`, into a nested list. This illustrates how lists can store other lists, allowing for complex data structures.

5. **Commenting Out Code**:
   - Several lines in the script are commented out (e.g., `import my_module`, modifications to `states_of_america`, and the original `dirty_dozen` list). This demonstrates how to temporarily disable code in Python without deleting it, useful for testing and debugging.

This exercise provided a broad overview of different Python features, from random number generation and list manipulation to commenting and basic data structures.

#### [B. Heads or Tails](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-004/Exercises/1-heads-or-tails.py)

In this exercise, I created a simple "Heads or Tails" program using Python's `random` module. This exercise demonstrates the use of random number generation and basic conditional logic.

The program works as follows:

1. **Import the Random Module**: The first step is importing the `random` module, which provides functions for generating random numbers.

2. **Generate a Random Integer**: The program uses `random.randint(0, 1)` to generate a random integer that's either 0 or 1. This simulates the two possible outcomes of a coin flip.

3. **Conditional Logic to Determine the Outcome**:
   - An `if` statement checks the value of `face_value`. If it equals 0, the program prints "Tails". Otherwise, it prints "Heads".
   - This binary choice effectively simulates the flipping of a coin.

#### [C. Banker Roulette](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-004/Exercises/2-banker-roulette.py)

In the "Banker Roulette" exercise, I implemented a program in Python that randomly selects a person from a list to "buy the meal today." This exercise demonstrates string manipulation, list handling, and the use of the `random` module for generating random numbers.

The program's workflow is as follows:

1. **Input and String Splitting**:
   - The program starts by asking the user to input a string of names separated by commas.
   - It then uses the `split(", ")` method on the input string to create a list of names. This method splits the string at every comma followed by a space, effectively turning a single string into a list of individual names.

2. **Importing and Using the Random Module**:
   - The `random` module is imported at the beginning of the program.
   - To select a random name, the program first calculates the length of the names list and adjusts it to align with Python's zero-based indexing (hence `len(names) - 1`).

3. **Random Selection**:
   - `random.randint(0, name_len)` is used to generate a random index between 0 and the last index of the names list.
   - The program then uses this index to select a random name from the list.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints out a message stating which name (person) is selected to buy the meal.

#### [D. Treasure Map](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-004/Exercises/3-treasure-map.py)

In the "Treasure Map" exercise, I developed a program in Python that simulates placing a treasure mark on a simple grid map. This exercise is a great example of using lists, indexing, and conditional logic in Python.

1. **Creating the Map**:
   - The map is represented by a list of lists (`map`), where each sublist (`row1`, `row2`, `row3`) represents a row in the map.
   - Each row contains square symbols (`"⬜️"`) to represent empty spaces.

2. **Displaying the Initial Map**:
   - The initial state of the map is printed using formatted strings, showing the three rows of the map.

3. **User Input for Treasure Location**:
   - The program asks the user to input the position for placing the treasure. This position input is expected to be a two-digit number where the first digit represents the column and the second digit represents the row.

4. **Parsing the Input**:
   - The input string is processed to determine the specific row and column. The first digit (column) is adjusted by subtracting 1 to align with Python's zero-based indexing.
   - The second digit is used directly to identify the row as the input is in a user-friendly format (starting from 1).

5. **Updating the Map**:
   - Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`) determine which row to update based on the user's input.
   - The appropriate row is then updated by replacing the corresponding square symbol with an "X" to mark the treasure's location.

6. **Printing the Updated Map**:
   - Finally, the updated map is printed, showing the new position of the treasure.

This exercise effectively demonstrates how to manipulate lists and use indexing in Python. It also provides a clear example of how user input can be taken and processed to interact with data structures, in this case, updating a list based on the input.

## Day 5

### Projects (Day 5)

#### [5. Password Generator](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-005/Projects/5-password-generator.py)

### Exercises (Day 5)

#### [A. Basic Loops](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-005/Exercises/0-basic-loops.py)

In this exercise, I explored the use of basic loops in Python, focusing on the `for` loop with two distinct examples.

The first part of the exercise involved iterating over a list of fruits. I defined a list named `fruits` containing "Apple", "Peach", and "Pear". Using a `for` loop, I iterated through each item in the list. For each fruit, the loop printed the fruit's name and then the fruit's name followed by " Pie". This demonstrated how to access and manipulate list elements within a loop, a fundamental skill in Python for working with collections of data.

The second part of the exercise demonstrated the use of the `range` function with a `for` loop. I initialized a variable `total_number` to 0 and used a `for` loop to iterate over a range of numbers from 1 to 100. In each iteration, the loop added the current number to `total_number`. This section illustrated how `range` can be used for numeric iteration and how to accumulate a sum within a loop. The final print statement displayed the total sum of numbers from 1 to 100.

Overall, these examples served as an introduction to `for` loops in Python. They showed how loops can be used for iterating over lists and performing repeated calculations. Such techniques are essential in Python for automating tasks, processing data, and carrying out calculations over sequences.

#### [B. Average Height](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-005/Exercises/1-average-height.py)

In this exercise, I created a program to calculate the average height from a list of student heights in Python, demonstrating basic data collection, type conversion, and arithmetic operations.

The program begins by prompting the user to input a list of student heights, which are entered as a space-separated string. This string is then split into a list of individual height strings using `.split()`. The `for` loop that follows converts each string in the list to an integer, updating the `student_heights` list with these integer values. This conversion is crucial for the arithmetic operations that follow.

The next part of the code involves calculating the total height and counting the number of students. Two separate `for` loops are used for this purpose. The first loop iterates over each height in the `student_heights` list, adding the heights to the `total_height` variable. The second loop counts the number of students by incrementing `student_count` for each element in the `student_heights` list.

Finally, the average height is calculated by dividing the `total_height` by `student_count` and rounding the result to the nearest whole number. This average is then printed out. This exercise effectively demonstrates handling user input, iterating over lists, basic arithmetic operations, and type conversion in Python. It's a practical example of how Python can be used to process and analyze data inputs.

#### [C. High Score](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-005/Exercises/2-high-score.py)

In this Python exercise, I developed a program to find the highest score in a list of student scores. The exercise emphasized the use of loops, conditional statements, and handling user input.

The program starts by requesting the user to input a list of student scores as a space-separated string. This string is then split into a list of individual score strings using the `.split()` method. A `for` loop is then employed to iterate through this list, converting each string score to an integer. This conversion is essential for the comparison operations that follow.

Once the scores are converted into integers, the code aims to identify the highest score. To achieve this, a variable `high_score` is initialized to 0. The program then iterates over each score in the `student_scores` list using a `for` loop. Within this loop, a conditional statement checks if the current score is greater than the value stored in `high_score`. If it is, `high_score` is updated with this new value. This loop-and-check mechanism ensures that at the end of the iteration, `high_score` holds the maximum score from the list.

The final step is to print the highest score. The program outputs this information in a formatted string, clearly indicating the highest score found in the class.

#### [D. Adding Even Numbers](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-005/Exercises/3-adding-even-nums.py)

In this exercise, I implemented a Python program to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100, demonstrating the use of loops, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations.

The program defines a variable `total_number` initialized to 0. This variable is used to accumulate the sum of even numbers. A `for` loop is then used to iterate over a range of numbers from 1 to 100. The `range(1, 101)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at 100.

Within the loop, a conditional statement checks whether each number is even. This is done using the modulus operator (`%`), which returns the remainder of a division. If a number divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 (`number % 2 == 0`), it is an even number. When an even number is identified, it is added to `total_number`.

After the loop completes, the program prints `total_number`, which by then contains the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100.

#### [E. FizzBuzz](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-005/Exercises/4-fizz-buzz.py)

In this exercise, I implemented the classic "FizzBuzz" program in Python, a common test used in programming interviews. The task was to print each number from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz". This exercise highlighted the use of loops, conditional statements, and modulo operations.

The program utilizes a `for` loop to iterate over a range of numbers from 1 to 100. For each number in this range, a series of conditional checks are performed:

1. The first `if` statement checks if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (`num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0`). If true, "FizzBuzz" is printed. This check is important to perform first to ensure that numbers like 15, which are divisible by both, are correctly identified as "FizzBuzz" rather than just "Fizz" or "Buzz".

2. The `elif` (else if) statement then checks if the number is divisible by 3 (`num % 3 == 0`). If true, it prints "Fizz".

3. Another `elif` statement checks if the number is divisible by 5 (`num % 5 == 0`). If true, it prints "Buzz".

4. Finally, the `else` statement covers all other cases where the number is neither divisible by 3 nor 5. In these cases, the number itself is printed.

This exercise demonstrates the practical application of loops for iterating over a range, the use of modulo operator to check divisibility, and the implementation of conditional logic to determine what to print based on these divisibility checks.

### Exercises (Day 8)

#### [A. Greet Function](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-008/Exercises/1-greet-function.py)

In this exercise, I developed a Python program that demonstrates the use of functions, specifically focusing on creating a custom function for greeting a user. The task involved obtaining user input for a name and location, and then using these inputs in a personalized greeting.

The program starts by asking the user two questions: the name of the person they are greeting and where that person lives. These inputs are captured using the `input()` function and stored in the variables `name` and `location`, respectively.

Following this, a function named `greet` is defined. This function takes two parameters: `name` and `location`. Inside the function, three print statements are used to generate a personalized greeting. The first print statement says hello to the person, the second asks about the location they are in, and the third makes a remark about the day being lovely, addressing the person by name again. This use of parameters within the function allows for dynamic and reusable code.

Finally, the `greet` function is called with `name` and `location` as arguments. This call executes the function with the specific inputs provided by the user, displaying the customized greeting messages.

#### [B. Paint Area Calculator](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-008/Exercises/2-paint-area-calculator.py)

In this exercise, I created a Python program to calculate the number of cans of paint needed to paint a wall, showcasing the use of functions, arithmetic operations, and external libraries.

The program begins by importing the `math` module, which provides access to various mathematical functions. One of these functions, `math.ceil()`, is used later in the code to round up to the nearest whole number.

The core functionality of the program is encapsulated within the `paint_calc` function. This function takes three parameters: `height`, `width`, and `cover`. The `height` and `width` parameters represent the dimensions of the wall to be painted, while `cover` represents the coverage of a single can of paint (in square units).

Inside the function, the total number of cans needed is calculated by dividing the area of the wall (`height * width`) by the coverage per can (`cover`). Since it's not practical to buy a fraction of a can, the result is rounded up to the nearest whole number using `math.ceil()`. This ensures that there is enough paint to cover the entire wall. The function then prints out the number of cans needed.

To use this function, the program prompts the user to input the height and width of the wall. These inputs are captured using `input()` and converted to integers. The variable `coverage` is set to 5, representing the area that a single can of paint can cover.

Finally, the `paint_calc` function is called with the user-provided height and width, along with the predefined coverage. The function calculates and displays the number of paint cans required.

#### [C. Prime Number Check](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-008/Exercises/3-prime-number-check.py)

In this exercise, I developed a Python program to check whether a given number is a prime number, demonstrating the use of functions, loops, and conditional statements.

The program defines a function named `prime_checker` which takes one parameter: `number`. This function is responsible for determining whether the provided number is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

The function first checks if the number is greater than 1, as prime numbers are by definition greater than 1. If the number is not greater than 1, it immediately prints that it's not a prime number.

For numbers greater than 1, the function uses a `for` loop to check for factors other than 1 and the number itself. It iterates through numbers starting from 2 up to, but not including, the number in question. For each number `i` in this range, the function checks if the `number` is divisible by `i` (`number % i == 0`). If any such division is found (indicating the number is divisible by a number other than 1 and itself), the function prints that it's not a prime number and exits the loop using `break`.

If the loop completes without finding any factors, the `else` block corresponding to the `for` loop is executed, indicating that no divisors were found and the number is a prime. The function then prints that it's a prime number.

To use this function, the program prompts the user to input a number. This input is captured using `input()`, converted to an integer, and stored in variable `n`. The `prime_checker` function is then called with `n` as its argument.

This exercise is a good example of how Python can be used to solve mathematical problems and demonstrates the practical application of functions, loops, and conditional logic in programming.

#### [D. Building Caesar Cipher - Part 1](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-008/Exercises/4-caesar-cipher1.py)

In the first part of building a Caesar Cipher in Python, I focused on creating a basic encryption function. The program starts with a list called `alphabet`, which contains all the lowercase letters of the alphabet, repeated twice to facilitate letter shifting for encryption.

The user is prompted to input a message and the number of positions to shift each letter in the message (the shift value). The `encrypt` function is then defined to perform the encryption. It takes the text and the shift value as arguments. Inside the function, for each letter in the input text, its position in the `alphabet` list is found. This position is then shifted by the specified shift amount to find the new letter. The new letter is added to a string `cipher_text`, which accumulates the encrypted message. After processing all letters, the encrypted message is printed.

This part of the exercise demonstrates the basics of string manipulation, use of lists, and iteration with `for` loops in Python, forming the foundation for a simple Caesar Cipher encryption tool.

#### [E. Building Caesar Cipher - Part 2](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-008/Exercises/5-caesar-cipher2.py)

In the second part of the Caesar Cipher exercise, I expanded the functionality to include decryption. The initial setup remains the same with an `alphabet` list and user input for text, direction (encode or decode), and shift amount.

Two functions are defined in this part: `encrypt` (similar to Part 1) and `decrypt`. The `decrypt` function reverses the encryption process. It takes the encrypted text and the shift value, then for each letter in the encrypted text, finds its position in the `alphabet` list. It then shifts the position backwards by the shift amount to retrieve the original letter and constructs the decrypted message.

The program checks the user input for direction and calls the appropriate function (either `encrypt` or `decrypt`). This part of the exercise illustrates how to add more functionality to a program, specifically how to reverse an algorithm's effect, a common requirement in encryption and decryption scenarios.

#### [F. Building Caesar Cipher - Part 3](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/blob/main/Day-008/Exercises/6-caesar-cipher3.py)

In the final part of the Caesar Cipher exercise, the code is optimized by combining the encryption and decryption functionalities into a single function called `caesar`. The program still starts with the `alphabet` list and takes user inputs for the direction of the operation (encode or decode), the message, and the shift value.

The `caesar` function is designed to handle both encryption and decryption based on the direction specified. It uses modular arithmetic (`% 52`, where 52 is twice the length of the alphabet list) to ensure the new position of each letter wraps around the alphabet list correctly. This is crucial as it deals with the issue of the shift operation moving beyond the end of the list.

For encoding, each letter's position is found and shifted forward; for decoding, the process is reversed by shifting backward. The resulting letters are concatenated to form the encoded or decoded message, which is then printed.

This part of the exercise demonstrates the use of modular arithmetic in programming to create more robust and error-resistant applications. It shows the importance of optimizing code by combining similar functionalities and the practical use of functions to simplify complex tasks.

In this exercise, I demonstrated the use of dictionaries in Python, a powerful data structure for storing key-value pairs. The exercise covered creating a dictionary, adding to it, accessing its elements, and iterating through it.

I created a `programming_dictionary` with initial entries for "Bug" and "Function," each paired with their definitions. I accessed and printed individual definitions using their keys and also displayed the entire dictionary to show its contents.

Next, I expanded the dictionary by adding a new entry for "Loop" and its definition. This step highlighted how to dynamically add new key-value pairs to a dictionary.

Finally, I used a `for` loop to iterate over each key in the dictionary, printing both the key and its associated value. This part of the exercise showcased how to efficiently traverse a dictionary and access its contents.

### Projects (Day 70)

#### [70. Using Git/GitHub](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller/2023-python-100-days/tree/main#day-70)

The original purpose of this lesson was to start learning how to use Git for version control and GitHub for version control hosting. However, I started this project from Day 1 using Git/GitHub.

I might come back to this at some point to make a Git helper script/application using Python, but I decided to give myself a free pass for now since I've been using Git from Day 1!
